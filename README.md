## Overview

The subject of this analysis is a Kaggle dataset Medical Appointment No Shows which describes more than 110,000 medical appointments in health units located within the city of Vitoria, Brazil and 14 features of each appointment.

## Data

Not all the data were clearly explained by the author in Data Dictionary, however some clarifications provided in the Discussion section allowed to conclude the following about features:

__PatientId__ - identification of a patient.  
__AppointmentID__ - identification of each appointment.  
__Gender__ - gender of a patient: male or female.  
__ScheduledDay__ - a date on which an appointment was scheduled.  
__AppointmentDay__ - a date of an appointment.  
__Age__ - age of a patient.  
__Neighbourhood__ - a neighbourhood where an appointment took place.  
__Scholarship__ - if a patient has government financial aid Bolsa Familia: yes or no.  
__Hipertension__ - if a patient has high blood pressure: yes or no.  
__Diabetes__ - if a patient has diabetes: yes or now.  
__Alcoholism__ - if a patient is suffering from alcoholism: yes or now.  
__Handcap__ - if a patient has disability: the number of all of them.  
__SMS_received__ - if a patient got a text message appointment reminders: yes or no.  
__No-show__ - if a patient came to an appointment: no for "came" and yes for "didn't come".  

## What was done 

Thus, on the basis of these variables, the following questions can be investigated:   
 
1. Are patient no-shows related to a patient's personal features such as age, gender, the mentioned diseases, disabilities or getting government financial aid?
2. Do the appointment reminders affect the coming to the appointment?
3. Is the number of days between the date when the appointment was scheduled and the appointment date related to whether the patient come to the appointment or not?
4. Are there neighbourhoods where the patients are more likely not to miss their appointments?
